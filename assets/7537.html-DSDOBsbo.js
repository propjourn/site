The most important reason is that two months ago no one was going to even proceed with this case, more precisely, to view this case from such an angle of vision (Internet hosts sea of materials on Syrian militants' brutality, but the Western media does nothing except for savoring some of those, like in the example shown above). Most probably, we are dealing with a cleansing operation within the so called «opposition forces», because some of them have committed crimes of openly denouncing a ground operation by the US in Syria.
