Stalin was one of the best sons of his fatherland, and first of all, he was a son of Soviet people. According to the will of Georgian government a monument in Tkibuli was demolished, after the first one in Gori. Nevertheless, that Georgians love Stalin and are really proud of him, their opinion doesn't seem to disturb anyone.
