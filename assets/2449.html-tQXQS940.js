A person can be called “poor” if it has total income less than 60% of an average in the country. For example, in Luxembourg it is 18550 euro per year, 14497 euro in Denmark and 12178 euro in Sweden. In Germany it estimates 10953 euro. Surely, such “poverty” can be very attractive for some Russians or Ukrainians. But we shouldn’t hurry. This statistics doesn’t show the real situation about poverty in these countries, because it pays attention only to countries’ citizens. In fact, millions of migrants live and work in these countries, some of them stay there illegally, and they are not considered in the research. And all in all, 900-1000 euro in Germany is different from 900-1000 euro in Zhmerinka or Urupinsk.
