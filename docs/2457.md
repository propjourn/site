# The unpaid wages are growing in Ukraine

**2010-07-03** Автор неизвестен

The newly elected Ukrainian authority does its best trying to show its functioning through rose-coloured spectacles, but the reality stays the same.

Thus, due to the data of the Ucrainian State Committee of Statistics, this year the unpaid wages reached 1 billion 887 million griwnjas (240 million USD). It is the worst index since the second half of 2004. Of course, the workers of the state-financed institutions suffer from wage indebtedness, first of all medical workers and teachers.
