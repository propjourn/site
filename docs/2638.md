# Each sixth teacher in Ukraine is a pensioner

**2010-08-29** Автор неизвестен

There are more and more teachers of advanced age in Ukraine. Thus, in the beginning of 2010 pensioners will make more than 16% of all Ukrainian teachers, the Minister of education and science of Ukraine Dmitro Tabachnik informs. The number of teachers younger than 30 years grows smaller each year. 4,5 years ago they made up 21%, now they make only 17%.

The biggest number of pensioner teachers has Sevastopol (28%), Donetsk region (almost 25%) and Crimea (24%).

The graduates of pedagogical universities and colleges do not want to work in schools because of the law salaries. They get their education at the expense of the state but after finishing the studies they prefer working for the private companies.
