# Ukrainian metropolitans and patriarchs live in luxurious villas

**2010-12-19** Автор неизвестен

The metropolitan of Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow patriarchate Vladimir live in a luxury house in Kiev in a district, where a ground lot costs 5 million grivnas.

This ground the church literally extorted from its "historical heir" Beregovenko Viktor, whose ancestors possessed this ground before the revolution in 1917. Six years the old man was at low with the church officials, then his house suddenly burned down (apparently, it was the gods curse), and then the church officially obtained the ground.

Vladimirs opponent, the head of the Kiev patriarchate Filaret is also soppy on elite "cells". He has several luxury houses near the Ukrainian capital, guarded by special guards and dogs.
