The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Konstantin Grishchenko, who is now officially visiting Cuba, thanks the government of Cuba for the medical help which this small island rendered to 26 000 of Ukrainian citizens who suffered from the Chernobyl accident in 1986. Grishchenko visited the health resort in Tarara, where the program of treatment and health improvement is being carried out.

Grishchenko stressed, that although his visit is devoted to the development of the economical, trade and scientific relations with Cuba, the main value is the human life, that's why Ukraine will always be grateful for the help rendered by Cuban government and Cuban people to those who suffered from the accident on Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

This year the program of help celebrates its 20th anniversary.
